**Background**

In the new role as the data visualization expert for a major metro paper, I was tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs and interactions to help readers understand my findings.

Through this project, I have created an impressive visualization effect that will visually provide the 
correlation between various factors so that additional investments will be made to further explore the
details to write a series of reports.

I also wanted to show to the editor a scatter plot to demonstrate the correlation

**Data Source**

I took the data given as part of the project and selected the following 6 attributes for the analysis 
apart from the state name and abbreviations.

    1) Poverty Level Vs. Healthcare
    2) Currently smoking Vs. Age
    3) Income Level Vs. Obese

**Data Visualization**

Using the D3 techniques, I created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. Generated the chart in the d3.html which displays the graphic just as we'd like it to, embed it in index.html with an iframe.

Included state abbreviations in the circles and created the axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

Included three different analysis attributes. Placed additional labels in the scatter plot and provided click events so that users can decide which data to display. Animated the transitions for the circles' locations as well as the range of the axes.

Added tooltips to the circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected. Added responsive function to optimize the scatter plot so that its data is accessible via various devices.

Finally, provided an analysis / insights to explain, what are the conclusions coming out of the correlation
computation and scatter plot analysis.
